# hw4

in this repository, p1 is part 1 of hw4, p3 is part 2 of hw4, p4 is part 3 of hw4, while final is the folder of final project

in order to use these files, basicaly the only file needed is main.cpp for all these folders, and in p3, p4, final, they just need one more python file to execute

python files are for openMV, once these files are ready, you are ready to execute these functions

in final, because of my broken XBees, I can only finish my project without them, and my task is to detect the line then run the car, then stop when it sees an apriltag
